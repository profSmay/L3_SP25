def main():
    """
    This program is designed to solicit input from the CLI and return a probability from the Gaussian Normal Distribution
    by integrating the probability density function using Simpson's 1/3 rule for numerical integration.

    The user may decide upon a two-sided integration or one-sided integration.
    If one-sided, we integrate from the smaller of mean-5*stDev or c-stDev.
    If two-sided, we integrate from -c to c.
    Here is my step-by-step plan:
    1. Decide mean, stDev, and c and if I want P(x>c) or P(x<c) or P(-c<x<c) or P(-c>x>c).
    2. Define args tuple and c to be passed to Probability
    3. Pass args, and a callback function (GPDF) to Probability
    4. In probability, pass along GPDF to Simpson along with the appropriate args tuple
    5. Return the required probability from Probability and print to screen.
    :return: Nothing to return, just print results to screen.
